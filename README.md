# Lido L2

This project contains the implementations of the L2 ERC20 token bridge for Optimism chain. The current solution allows transferring ERC20 tokens between L1 and L2 chains.

To retrieve more detailed info about the bridging process, see the specifications for certain chains:

- [Lido's Optimism Bridge](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2/blob/main/contracts/optimism/README.md).
- [wstETH Bridging Guide](https://docs.lido.fi/token-guides/wsteth-bridging-guide/#r-5-bridging-l1-lido-dao-decisions)

## Project setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lidofinance/lido-l2.git
cd ./lido-l2
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the contracts:

```bash
npm run compile
```

## Configure ENV variables

The simplest way to create `.env` file is via cloning the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill the newly created `.env` file with the required variables. See the [Project Configuration](#Project-Configuration) section for the complete list of configuration options.

## Bridge deployment

The configuration of the deployment scripts happens via the ENV variables. The following variables are required:

- [`TOKEN`](#TOKEN) - address of the non-rebasable token to deploy a new bridge on the Ethereum chain.
- [`REBASABLE_TOKEN`] (#REBASABLE_TOKEN) - address of the rebasable token to deploy new bridge on the Ethereum chain.
- [`L1_OP_STACK_TOKEN_RATE_PUSHER`](#L1_OP_STACK_TOKEN_RATE_PUSHER) - address of token rate pusher. Required to config TokenRateOracle.
- [`L2_GAS_LIMIT_FOR_PUSHING_TOKEN_RATE`](#L2_GAS_LIMIT_FOR_PUSHING_TOKEN_RATE) - gas limit required to complete pushing token rate on L2.This value was calculated by formula: l2GasLimit = (gas cost of L2Bridge.finalizeDeposit() + OptimismPortal.minimumGasLimit(depositData.length)) * 1.5

## Tests running

### Unit tests

To run unit tests use one of the following commands:

```bash

# Run tests for Optimism bridge
npm run test:unit

```

### Integration tests

Before running integration tests, run the hardhat forked nodes in the standalone tabs. Example of the commands:

```bash
# Required to run integration tests
